            <p>Over the years, I've been drawn to the intersection of tech and creativity. This space showcases some of the tools and projects I've tinkered with. They're a mix of my curiosity, a desire to experiment, and a bit of playful engineering. Have a look around and I hope you find something interesting.</p>

            <p>After purchasing my first drone, I encountered several close calls during flights that could have ended disastrously. I often flew over large bodies of water and had near-misses with trees and other obstacles. My solution: develop a "trigger" mechanism to deploy an airbag for a drone. Focusing on design sustainability and compact packaging, I created a casing to house a microcontroller, CO2 cartridge, and servo. Currently, I am developing a method to trigger the gas canister using a barometric pressure sensor to detect altitude changes.</p>

            <img src="images/urop.png" alt="UROP Project" class="project-image">
            <p>This project focused on creating a machine learning-based system to detect errors in 3D printing processes. Using annotated image data labeled with bounding boxes via CVAT, I trained a YOLO object detection model to identify and classify printing defects in real time. The ultimate goal was to improve 3D printing quality assurance by automating the detection of commonly replaced or defective parts.</p>

            <p>At the start of my work with the McAlpine Research Group, my first task was to design and prototype a camera mount compatible with an Aerotech 3D printer. The mount was designed for greater adjustability and vibration resistance, securing a camera for in-situ monitoring and filming of conformal printing processes. These prints were used to create cricothyrotomy samples for medical students to practice the procedure.</p>

            <p>For this project, I wanted to expand my programming skills and gain experience with hardware, specifically computer hardware. I designed a durable, rugged case to house a Raspberry Pi computer board. Initially, I planned to use the mini PC to host this website, but after researching potential vulnerabilities to hackers, I pivoted its purpose to another application.

            <h3>Product Engineering Intern at Benchmark Electronics</h3>
            <p>Summer 2023</p>
            <p>
                My first internship at Benchmark Electronics was a fantastic introduction to the industry. While my initial goal was to gain some hands-on experience, the role ended up being an invaluable opportunity to develop skills in Design for Manufacturing (DFM). I worked closely with experienced engineers and learned how to design products that are easier to manufacture and assemble. This knowledge gave me a new appreciation for the practical challenges of engineering, especially the importance of bridging the gap between design and production. I also picked up valuable technical skills, such as automating repetitive tasks with Python, Excel, and VBA. Overall, it was an eye-opening experience that gave me a unique insight into the difficulties of manufacturing that should be considered during the design stage.

            <h3>Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Intern at The Toro Company</h3>
            <p>Summer 2024</p>
            <p>
                At Toro, I worked as an Advanced Manufacturing Engineering Intern, but my role was heavily focused on design and prototyping. My primary project involved developing an end-stock and a mechanical frame to assist in producing zero-turn lawn mowers. This project required designing, iterating, and refining a solution that would improve efficiency and accuracy in manufacturing. The hands-on nature of the work allowed me to explore various design challenges, from stress analysis to assembly constraints, and prototype solutions in a fast-paced environment. While the position was rooted in manufacturing, it gave me significant exposure to mechanical design, and I was able to apply engineering principles to real-world problems, reinforcing my interest in design and R&D.
